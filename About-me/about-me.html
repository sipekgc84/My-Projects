      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="content">
        <p>After completing high school, I spent 2 years at Wake Technical Community College, in Raleigh, NC where I earned my associates degree in science. I was accepted to the School of the Arts at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC where I completed my junior year of college.  However, due to financial difficulty I was forced to seek employment.  I joined the US Navy in June 2009 and completed my Nuclear Training as an Electronics Technician (Nuclear) in the Submarine Force.</p>
        <p>From 2011 through 2015 I completed my first sea tour split touring between the USS HAWAII (SSN 776) AND USS TEXAS (SSN 775). I transitioned to my first shore command working at Nuclear Regional Maintenance Department (NRMD) at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard as a Ship Superintendent.  As the Guam Liaison I was responsible for coordinating complex nuclear corrective and preventative maintenance on US Navy Submarines between 2 different shipyards and Submarine Support Tender in Guam.</p>
        <p>Following a successful tour at NRMD, Pearl Harbor, HI, I began my second sea tour on the USS ILLINOIS (SSN 786) where I was introduced to the basics of coding and web design by my supervisor and mentor ETNC (SS) Parker.  Through this interaction I began learning to design and build web pages using HTML and CSS files.  I later transferred to the USS MISSISSIPPI (SSN 782) where I met more colleagues who further enhanced my drive to learn coding with the addition of JavaScript, SQL, and database design with Microsoft Access thanks to ETN1 (SS) Andre Hammons and EMN1 (SS) Cole Eiser</p>
